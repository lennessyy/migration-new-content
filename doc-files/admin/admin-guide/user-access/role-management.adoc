= Role Management

This page explains the procedures for various role management tasks under TigerGraph's authorization model.

[discrete]
=== Create a local role

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
CREATE ROLE <role_name> (, <role_name>)* [ON GRAPH <graph_name>]
----

*Required privilege*

`WRITE_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To create a local role, run the `CREATE ROLE` command like below. If you choose not to specify a graph in the command, the current scope will be used as the scope of the role:
+
[source,sql]
----
GSQL > USE GRAPH example_graph
GSQL > CREATE ROLE role1, role2
----

This will create two roles named `role1` and `role2` on graph `example_graph`. By default, these two roles do not have any privilege:

----
Successfully created local roles for graph 'example_graph': [role1, role2].
----

[discrete]
=== Create a global role

[discrete]
==== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
CREATE ROLE <role_name> (, <role_name>)* ON GLOBAL
----

[discrete]
==== Required privilege

`WRITE_ROLE` on the global scope

[discrete]
==== Procedure

. To create a global role, run the `CREATE ROLE` command like below. Replace `role1` with the name of the role you are creating.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE ROLE role1 ON GLOBAL
----

This will create a role named `role1` on the global scope. By default, this role has no privileges:

[source,bash]
----
Successfully created global roles: [role1].
----

[discrete]
=== View privileges of a role

*Syntax*

[source,text]
----
SHOW PRIVILEGE ON ROLE <role_name> (, <role_name2>)*
----

*Required privilege*

`READ_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To view the privileges of a role, run the `SHOW PRIVILEGE ON ROLE` command, and replace `role1, role2` with the names of the roles whose privileges you want to view:

[source,text]
----
GSQL > SHOW PRIVILEGE ON ROLE role1 , role2
----

This will show the privileges of the role `role1` and `role2:`

[source,text]
----
Role: "role1"
  - Graph 'tpc_graph' Privileges:
    WRITE_QUERY

Role: "role2"
This role has no privilege.
----

[discrete]
=== List all existing roles

*Syntax*

[source,text]
----
SHOW ROLE
----

*Required privilege*

`READ_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To list all existing roles, first ensure that you are in the correct scope. Run `USE <graph_name>` or `USE GLOBAL` to switch to your desired scope.
. Run the `SHOW ROLE` command:
+
[source,text]
----
GSQL > SHOW ROLE
----

This will show all the roles in your current scope:

[source,text]
----
  - Builtin Roles:
    observer
    queryreader
    querywriter
    designer
    admin
    globaldesigner
    superuser

  - User Defined Roles:
    - Graph 'tpc_graph' Roles:
      role1
      role2
----

[discrete]
=== Grant privileges to a role

*Syntax*

[source,text]
----
GRANT PRIVILEGE <privilege_name1> (, privilege_name2)*
        [ON GRAPH <graph_name>] TO <role_name1> (, <role_name2>)*
----

*Require privilege*

`WRITE_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To grant privileges to a role, run the `GRANT PRIVILEGE` command from the GSQL shell:
+
[source,text]
----
GSQL > GRANT PRIVILEGE WRITE_QUERY, WRITE_ROLE
        ON GRAPH example_graph TO role1 , role2
----

This will allow users with the roles `role1` and `role2` to edit and install queries, as well as modify roles on the graph `example_graph`. To see a full list of privileges and the command they allow users to run, see xref:../reference/list-of-privileges.adoc[List of Privileges].

[discrete]
=== Revoke privileges from a role

*Syntax*

[source,text]
----
REVOKE PRIVILEGE <privilege_name1> (, privilege_name2)*
        [ON GRAPH <graph_name>] FROM <role_name1> (, <role_name2>)*
----

*Required privilege*

`WRITE_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To revoke privileges from a role, run the `REVOKE PRIVILEGE` command from the GSQL shell:
+
[source,text]
----
GSQL > REVOKE PRIVILEGE WRITE_QUERY
        ON GRAPH example_graph FROM role1
----

This will revoke the `WRITE_QUERY` privilege from the role `role1` on graph `example_graph.`

[discrete]
=== Drop a role

*Syntax*

[source,text]
----
DROP ROLE <role_name> (, <role_name2>)*
----

*Required privilege*

`WRITE_ROLE`

*Procedure*

. To drop a role, run the `DROP ROLE` command from the GSQL shell:
+
[source,text]
----
GSQL > DROP ROLE role1 , role2
----

This will drop the roles `role1` and `role2`. This will also revoke the roles from users who have been granted these roles.
