= The GSQL Shell

The GSQL shell is a fully functional Java environment for interacting with the TigerGraph database. It is included in a standard TigerGraph installation. 

== Launch the shell
As the TigerGraph Linux user, type `gsql` into the bash terminal to start a GSQL shell session:

[source,bash]
----
$ gsql
----

If authentication is enabled, you will need to provide credentials in order to launch the shell. 

== Run a GSQL script
You don't always need to enter the interactive shell in order to run a GSQL command. To run a GSQL command non-interactively, run the command `gsql` followed by the GSQL commands you want to run in quotes:

[source,bash]
----
$ gsql 'ls'
----
