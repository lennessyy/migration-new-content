TigerGraph provides support for TigerGraph Cloud for customers with non-free-tier solutions. For more information on TigerGraph's support policy, visit our https://www.tigergraph.com/support-policy/[support policy page].

== Submit a support ticket

You can submit a support ticket in the TigerGraph Cloud portal or by email.

=== 1. Submit a support ticket

Click on the support icon image:../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-05-06-at-2.52.22-pm.png[], and fill out the form that pops up with information relevant to your issue. If you cannot access the TigerGraph Cloud portal, you can also email support@tigergraph.com to submit your support ticket. Either approach will automatically generate a support ticket in https://tigergraph.freshdesk.com/support/home[TigerGraph's FreshDesk support system], and you will receive an email with the link to your ticket.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please remember to use the email account associated with your TigerGraph Cloud account to submit the support email to link:mailto:support@tigergraph.com[support@tigergraph.com] so that TigerGraph Cloud Support can verify your account.
{% endhint %}

=== 2. Setup your FreshDesk account (first ticket submission only)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have a FreshDesk account with TigerGraph, you can skip this step.
{% endhint %}

When you submit a support ticket through TigerGraph Cloud or through email, and you don't already have a FreshDesk account with TigerGraph, an account will be created for you automatically. An account setup email titled *Welcome to TigerGraph Support* will be sent to you at the email address associated with your TigerGraph Cloud account, and you can follow the instructions in the email to set up your account.

This setup email might arrive a few minutes later than the email containing the link to your ticket.

=== 3. Follow up on your ticket

If you have a paid subscription with TigerGraph, a support representative will be reviewing your request and will send you a personal response (usually within 24 hours). You can follow up on your ticket either by replying to the email thread or in FreshDesk.
