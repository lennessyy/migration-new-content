= System & Language Basics
:pp: {plus}{plus}

== *Language Basics*

* *Identifiers*  Identifiers are user-defined names. An identifier consists of letters, digits, and the underscore.  Identifiers may not begin with a digit.  Identifiers are case sensitive.
* *Keywords and Reserved Words*  Keywords are words with a predefined semantic meaning in the language. Keywords are not case sensitive. Reserved words are set aside for use by the language, either now or in the future. Reserved words may not be reused as user-defined identifiers.  In most cases, a keyword is also a reserved word.  For example, VERTEX is a keyword.  It is also a reserved word, so VERTEX may not be used as an identifier.
* *Statements*  Each line corresponds to one statement (except in multi-line mode). Usually, there is no punctuation at the end of a top-level statement. Some statements, such as CREATE LOADING JOB, are block statements which enclose a set of statements within themselves. Some punctuation may be needed to separate the statements within a block.
* *Comments*  Within a command file, comments are text that is ignored by the language interpreter.  Single line comments begin with either # or //. A comment may be on the same line with interpreted code . Text to the left of the comment marker is interpreted, and text to the right of the marker is ignored.  Multi-line comment blocks begin with /* and end with */

== *Running GSQL*

To enter the GSQL shell and work in interactive mode, type *`gsql`* from an operating system shell prompt. A user name, password, and a graph name may also be provided on the command line.

{% code title="GSQL command syntax for entering interactive mode" %}

[source,sql]
----
gsql [-u username] [-p password] [-g gname]
----

{% endcode %}

If a user name is provided but not a password, the GSQL system will then ask for the user's password:

{% code title="Login example with user name" %}

[source,sql]
----
os$ gsql -u victor
Password for victor : ***
GSQL >
----

{% endcode %}

If a user name is not given, then GSQL will assume that you are attempting to log in as the default tigergraph user:

{% code title="Login example without user name" %}

[source,sql]
----
os$ gsql
Password for tigergraph : *****
GSQL >
----

{% endcode %}

To exit the GSQL shell, type either ``exit``or ``quit``at the GSQL prompt:

`GSQL> EXIT`  or `GSQL> QUIT`

=== GSQL Client Session Timeout

For added security, you can configure your GSQL client session to automatically timeout after a period of inactivity. Set the GSQL_CLIENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC bash environment variable=<num_sec>. Then every time you start a GSQL session, the idle timeout will be applied. To disable the timeout, omit <num,_sec>.  The default setting is no timeout.  Example, using the Linux export command to set the environment variable:

[source,sql]
----
tigergraph@123:~$ export GSQL_CLIENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC=10
tigergraph@123:~$ gsql
Welcome to TigerGraph Developer Edition, free for non-production, research, or educational use.
GSQL-Dev > Session timeout after 10 seconds idle.
tigergraph@123:~$ export GSQL_CLIENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC=
tigergraph@123:~$ gsql
Welcome to TigerGraph Developer Edition, free for non-production, research, or educational use.
----

=== Multiple Shell Sessions

Multiple shell sessions of GSQL may be run at the same time.  This feature can be used to have multiple clients (human or machine) using the system to perform concurrent operations. A basic locking scheme is used to maintain isolation and consistency.

=== Multi-line Mode - BEGIN, END, ABORT

In interactive mode, the default behavior is to treat each line as one statement; the GSQL interpreter will activate as soon as the End-Of-Line character is entered.

Multi-line mode allows the user to enter several lines of text without triggering immediate execution.  This is useful when a statement is very long and the user would like to split it into multiple lines. It is also useful when defining a JOB, because jobs typically contain multiple statements.

To enter multi-line mode, use the command BEGIN.  The end-of-line character is now disabled from triggering execution.  The shell remains in multi-line mode until the command END is entered.  The END command also triggers the execution of the multi-line block.  In the example below, BEGIN and END are used to allow the SELECT statement to be split into several lines:

{% code title="Example: BEGIN and END defining a multi-line block" %}

[source,sql]
----
BEGIN
SELECT member_id, last_name, first_name,  date_joined, status
    FROM Member
    WHERE age >= 21
    ORDER BY last_name, first_name
END
----

{% endcode %}

Alternately, the ABORT command exits multi-line mode and discards the multi-line block.

=== *Command Files and Inline Commands*

A command file is a text file containing a series of GSQL statements.  Blank lines and comments are ignored. By convention, GSQL command files end with the suffix . *`gsql`* , but this is not a requirement. Command files are automatically treated as multi-line mode, so BEGIN and END statements are not needed. Command files may be run either from within the GSQL shell by prefixing the filename with an @ symbol:

GSQL> *@file.gsql*

or from the operating system (i.e., a Linux shell) by giving the filename as the argument after gsql:

os$ *gsql file.gsql*

Similarly, a single GSQL command can be run by enclosing the command string in quotation marks and placing it at the end of the GSQL statement.  Either single or double quotation marks.  It is recommended to use single quotation marks to enclose the entire command and double quotation marks to enclose any strings within the command.

{% code title="Login example with inline command or command file" %}

[source,sql]
----
gsql [-u username] [-g graphname] ['command_string' | command_file]
----

{% endcode %}

In the example below, the file name_query.gsql contains the multi-line CREATE QUERY block to define the query namesSimilar.

{% code title="Example using command files and inline commands" %}

[source,sql]
----
os$ gsql pagerank_query.gsql
os$ gsql 'INSTALL QUERY namesSimilar'
os$ gsql 'RUN QUERY namesSimilar (0,"michael","jackson",100)'
----

{% endcode %}

=== *Help and Information*

The *`help`* command displays a summary of the available GSQL commands:

GSQL> HELP [BASIC|QUERY]

Note that the HELP command has options for showing more details about certain categories of commands.

The *`ls`* command displays the _catalog_ : all the vertex types, edge types, graphs, queries, jobs, and session parameters which have been defined by the user.

=== --reset option

The --reset option will clear the entire graph data store and erase all related definitions (graph schema, loading jobs, and queries) from the Dictionary.  The data deletion cannot be undone; use with extreme caution. The REST{pp}, GPE, and GSE modules will be turned off.

[source,sql]
----
$ gsql --reset

Resetting the catalog.

Shutdown restpp gse gpe ...
Graph store /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/gstore/0/ has been cleared!
The catalog was reset and the graph store was cleared.
----

=== Summary

The table below summaries the basic system commands introduced so far.

|===
| Command | Description

| HELP[BASIC\|QUERY]
| Display the help menu for all or a subset of the commands

| LS
| Display the catalog, which records all the vertex types, edge types, graphs, queries, jobs, and session parameters that have been defined for the current active graph. See notes below concerning graph- and role-dependent visibility of the catalog.

| BEGIN
| Enter multi-line edit mode (only for console mode within the shell)

| END
| Finish multi-line edit mode and execute the multi-line block.

| ABORT
| Abort multi-line edit mode and discard the multi-line block.

| @file.gsql
| Run the gsql statements in the command file `file.gsql` from within the GSQL shell.

| `os$ gsql file.gsql`
| Run the gsql statements in the command file `file.gsql` from an operating system shell.

| `os$ gsql 'command_string'`
| Run a single gsql statement from the operating system shell.

| `os$ gsql --reset`

|===

{% hint style="info" %}
 Notes on the LS command

Starting with v1.2, the output of the LS command is sensitive to the user and the active graph:

. If the user has not set an active graph or specified "USE GLOBAL":
 .. If the user is a superuser, then LS displays global vertices, global edges, and all graph schemas.
 .. If the user is not a superuser, then LS displays nothing (null).
. If the user has set an active graph, then LS displays the schema, jobs, queries, and other definitions for that particular graph.
{% endhint %}

== *Session Parameters*

Session parameters are built-in system variables whose values are valid during the current session; their values do not endure after the session ends. In interactive command mode, a session starts and ends when entering and exiting interactive mode, respectively. When running a command file, the session lasts during the execution of the command file.

Use the SET command to set the value of a session parameter:

== *Attribute Data Types*

Each attribute of a vertex or edge has an assigned data type. The following types are currently supported.

=== Primitive Types

|===
| Name | Default value | Valid input format (regex) | Range and precision | Description

| `INT`
| 0
| [-+]?[0-9]+

| `BOOL`
| false
| true, false (case insensitive), 1, 0
| true, false
| boolean true and false, represented within GSQL as _true_ and _false_ , and represented in input and output as 1 and 0

| `STRING`
| Empty string
| .*

| character string. The string value can optionally be enclosed by single quote marks or double quote marks. Please see the QUOTE parameter in Section "Other Optional LOAD Clauses".
|===

{% hint style="danger" %}
For FLOAT and DOUBLE values, the GSQL Loader supports exponential notation as shown (e.g., 1.25 E-7).

The GSQL Query Language currently only reads values without exponents. It may display output values with exponential notation, however.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Some numeric expressions may return a non-numeric string result, such as "inf" for Infinity or "NaN" for Not a Number.

Additionally, GSQL also supports the following complex data types:

=== Collection Types

* `LIST`: A list is an *ordered* collection of elements of the same type.
 ** Default value: an empty list `[]`
 ** Supported element types: `INT`, `UINT`, `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, `STRING COMPRESS`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`
 ** To declare a list type, use angle brackets `<>` to enclose the element type, e.g. `LIST<STRING>.`

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to multithreaded GSQL loading, the initial order of elements loaded into a LIST might be different than the order in which they appeared in the input data.
{% endhint %}

* `SET`: A set is an *unordered* collection of *unique* elements of the same type.
 ** Default value: an empty set `()`
 ** Supported element types: `INT`, `UINT`, `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, `STRING COMPRESS`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`.
 ** To declare a set type, use angle brackets `<>` to enclose the element type, e.g. `SET<INT>`
* `MAP`: A map is a collection of key-value pairs. It cannot contain duplicate keys and each key maps to one value.
 ** Default value: an empty map
 ** Supported key types: `INT`, `STRING`, `STRING COMPRESS`, and `DATETIME`
 ** Supported value types: `INT`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `STRING COMPRESS`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`.
 ** To declare a map type, use `<>` to enclose the types, with a comma to separate the key and value types, e.g., `MAP<INT, DOUBLE>`.

=== TYPEDEF TUPLE

A *User-Defined Tuple (UDT)*  represents an ordered structure of several fields of the same or different types. The supported field types are listed below. Each field in a UDT has a fixed size. A `STRING` field must be given a size in characters, and the loader will only load the first given number of characters. An `INT` or `UINT` field can optionally be given a size in bytes.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="TYPEDEF TUPLE syntax" %}

[source,erlang]
----
TYPEDEF TUPLE "<" fieldName fieldType ["(" fieldSize ")"]
                  ( "," fieldName fieldType ["(" fieldSize ")"] )* ">" tupleName
----

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

|===
| Field type | User-specified size | Size | Range (N is size)

| `INT`
| Optional
| 1, 2, 4 (default), or 8 bytes
| 0 to 2{caret}(N*8) - 1

| `UINT`
| Optional
| 1, 2, 4 (default), or 8 bytes
| -2{caret}(N*8 - 1) to 2{caret}(N*8 - 1) - 1

| `FLOAT`
| No
| 4 bytes
| -3.4 E-38 to 3.4 E38

| `DOUBLE`
| No
| 8 bytes
| -1.7 E-308 to 1.7 E308

| `DATETIME`
| No
|
| 1582-10-15 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59

| `BOOL`
| No
|
| `true` or `false`

| `STRING`
| Required
| Any number of characters
| Any string under N characters
|===

A UDT must be defined before being used as a field in a vertex type or edge type. To define a UDT, use the `TYPEDEF TUPLE` statement. Below is an example of a `TYPEDEF TUPLE` statement:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example: UDT Definition " %}

[source,sql]
----
TYPEDEF TUPLE <field1 INT(1), field2 UINT, field3 STRING(10), field4 DOUBLE> myTuple
----

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the above example, `myTuple` is the name of the UDT. It contains four fields: an 1-byte `INT` field named `field1`, a 4-byte `UINT` field named `field2`, a 10-character `STRING` field named `field3`, and an (8-byte) `DOUBLE` field named `field4`.
