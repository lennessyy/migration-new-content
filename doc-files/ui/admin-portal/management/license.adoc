Please note that the GraphStudio item under Applications section needs to be lightened like above. If it looks like the grayed icon here: image:../../../.gitbook/assets/graphstudio_disabled%20%282%29.png[], it means GraphStudio is not enabled in the provided license, and you won't be able to use GraphStudio in this case.
