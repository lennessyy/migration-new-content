= GraphStudio Overview

== Overview

The TigerGraph GraphStudio™ UI (User Interface) provides an intuitive, browser-based interface that helps users get started quickly with graph-based application development tasks: designing a graph schema, creating a schema mapping, loading data, exploring the graph, and writing GSQL queries. This guide serves as an introduction and quick-start manual for the GraphStudio UI.

As of Jan 2020, the GraphStudio UI is certified on following browsers:

Not all features are guaranteed to work on other browsers.

=== GraphStudio In The Cloud +++<a id="graphstudio-in-the-cloud">++++++</a>+++

If you are using GraphStudio in the TigerGraph cloud environment, you can directly access GraphStudio via a browser.

=== GraphStudio On-Premises +++<a id="graphstudio-on-premises">++++++</a>+++

For on-premise deployment, the system by default is listening to port 14240. Any machine connected to the server can access GraphStudio from a browser with the following address:

[source,http]
----
http://<your_tigergraph_server_ip_address>:<your_tigergraph_server_port>
----

{% hint style="info" %}
In v1.2, the default TCP/IP port for GraphStudio has changed from 44240 to 14240, to avoid possible port conflicts with Zookeeper.
{% endhint %}

If you cannot access GraphStudio, check your firewall rules and open 14240 port to public. For example, if your Linux OS uses firewall-cmd:

[source,text]
----
$ firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-port=14240/tcp –permanent
----

If the GraphStudio UI shows some errors at the login page like below, the GUI service might be off.

To verify, in a linux shell of the server, type

 $ gadmin status gui

If it is off, turn it on:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin start gui
----

=== Home Page +++<a id="home-page">++++++</a>+++

The home page of GraphStudio contains links to each of the six steps of solving a business problem: Design Schema, Map Data To Graph, Load Data, Explore Graph, Build Graph Patterns and Write Queries. Users can also navigate to each step from the buttons in the left menu bar. Each of these major steps has its own page. To hide/show the left menu bar, click the top-left menu button:image:../../.gitbook/assets/toggle_nav_bar.png[]. Clicking the logo on the top of the left menuimage:../../.gitbook/assets/graphstudio-logo-10.22.48-am%20%282%29.png[]will take you back to the home page. You can clickimage:../../.gitbook/assets/goto_admin_portal.png[]to go to the Admin Portal (read more at link:[Admin Portal UI Guide]).

=== GraphStudio Session Timeout

GraphStudio has a default session timeout of 1 week. If, during this time, the user has no interaction with the page, the session will expire and the user will be logged out automatically. The timeout can be configured with:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin config set GUI.ClientIdleTimeMS [timeout]
----

=== GraphStudio Online Test Drive +++<a id="graphstudio-online-test-drive">++++++</a>+++

Visit TigerGraph Test Drive demos at: https://testdrive.tigergraph.com/

The GraphStudio online Test Drive features several instances of the TigerGraph system, each one targeting a different use case. Each copy of TigerGraph has a GraphStudio interface and is preloaded with application-specific queries and synthetic data. These demo applications are provided in a read-only mode. Users can explore and play with pre-installed queries. Users on these demo systems cannot save changes to the graph schema, the loading job, or queries. The corresponding buttons are disabled.

=== GraphStudio Limitations

Some features which are available in GSQL are not available in GraphStudio.

==== xref:design-schema.adoc[Design Schema]

* Fixed binary data types are not supported.
* PRIMARY KEY and composite key are not supported.

==== xref:map-data-to-graph.adoc[Map Data to Graph]

* Cannot load JSON data.

==== xref:../../start/gsql-101/load-data-gsql-101.adoc[Load Data]

* Data loading jobs written in a GSQL console are not shown in GraphStudio.
* USING options are not available.
