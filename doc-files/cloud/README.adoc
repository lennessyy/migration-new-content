= TigerGraph Cloud

TigerGraph Cloud is a fully-managed cloud database built on the same TigerGraph Enterprise Server engine that is delivering the fastest and most scalable graph database. TigerGraoh Cloud handles all the complexity of deploying and managing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS, Azure, and GCP).

Most of the documentation for TigerGraph Enterprise Server also applies to TigerGraph Cloud.  However, since TigerGraph Cloud does not have a command-line interface on the OS level, command-line features are not supported in the same way. In many cases, we introduced a GUI-based method for the same feature. For advanced OS-level commands, submit a support ticket for more information.
