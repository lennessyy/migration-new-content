= SELECT Statement

== GSQL Syntax Versions

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: Starting with TigerGraph 2.6, there are now two versions of the GSQL Query Language. Both are available in the product. The original version is called GSQL Syntax V1. GSQL Syntax V2 was introduced to provide more flexible and powerful link:../../../../start/gsql-102/[Pattern Matching]. A query indicates which grammar to use in the SYNTAX clause of the CREATE QUERY header. V1 is the default.

As new features are being added to GSQL, some are available only V2. In the future, we plan to transition so that Syntax V2 will be the default.

The key differences between the two grammars:

. SQL-like Tabular SELECT is only in Syntax V2 (since TigerGraph 3.1)
. Multi-hop Pattern Matching is only in Syntax V2 (since TigerGraph 2.6)
 ** In V2, each SELECT statement can traverse a multi-hop path.
  *** The traversal direction is under the control of the query writer, with arrowheads on each edge set to show the direction.
  *** There is no arrowhead outside the parentheses:
+
`Start:s -( (ForwardEdge> | <BackwardEdge):e )- Target:t`

  *** Users can write paths that explicitly show multiple hops, and they can use a Kleene star (*) to indicate repetition. `Start:s -(Edge1>:e1)- Middle:m -(<Edge2:e2)- Target:t` or `Start:s -(Edge*1..3)- Target:t`
 ** In V1 (default), each SELECT statement can traverse one hop (from a set of vertices to their adjacent vertices).
  *** To write a multi-hop query, you write a sequence of SELECT statements.
  *** The traversal action is from left to right, and the notation uses "ASCII art" to depict a connection, either with a rightward facing arrowhead or no arrowhead: `+Start:s -( Edges:e )-> Target:t+` or  `Start:s -( Edges:e )- Target:t`
{% endhint %}

This section discusses the SELECT statement in-depth and covers the following EBNF syntax. Note that there are now two forms for a SELECT statement, the classic GSQL form `gsqlSelectBlock`, and the new SQL-like form `sqlSelectBlock`. Since GSQL has always been similar to SQL in many ways, there are only a few differences to know about.

The SELECT block uses a _step_ _pattern_ or _path_ _pattern_ to select some of the graph's vertices and edges. There are a number of optional clauses that define and/or refine the selection by constraining the vertex or edge set or the result set. The final output of a query is either a vertex set known as the _result set_ or a table.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Size limitation

There is a maximum size limit of 2GB for the result set of a SELECT block . If the result of the SELECT block is larger than 2GB, the system will return no data. NO error message is produced.

== GSQL SELECT Statement

{% code title="EBNF for GSQL Select Statement" %}

gsqlSelectBlock := gsqlSelectClause
               fromClause
               [sampleClause]

gsqlSelectClause := vertexSetName "=" SELECT vertexAlias
----

{% endcode %}

In classic GSQL, the SELECT statement is an assignment statement with a SELECT block on the right hand side. The initial clause is the SELECT clause: `SELECT vertexAlias`. Its purpose is to specify which set of vertices from the FROM clause is to become the output. The classic SELECT clause may contain only one item: a vertex alias defined in the FROM clause. As of v3.1, the vertex alias may be from anywhere in a multi-hop pattern, not only an endpoint. GSQL now also supports link:./#sql-like-select-statement[SQL-like SELECT statements] with tabular output.

The link:./#from-clause-vertex-and-edge-sets[fromClause] defines a path pattern to traverse in the graph, and each vertex in the path pattern can be given a vertexAlias name. Thus, the SELECT clause picks the set of vertices at one of these points in the pattern -- the source vertices, the target vertices, or those from an interior point in a multi-hop path -- to be the output vertices.

The SELECT block has many optional clauses, which fit together in a logical flow. Overall, the SELECT block starts from a source set of vertices and returns a result set that is either a subset of the source vertices or a subset of their neighboring vertices. Along the way, computations can be performed on the selected vertices and edges. The figure below graphically depicts the overall SELECT data flow. While the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses do not directly affect which vertices are included in the result set, they affect the data (accumulators) which are attached to those vertices.

image::../../../../.gitbook/assets/select_statement_data_flow_v1.1.png[Basic data flow for a classic 1-hop GSQL SELECT statement]

== FROM Clause: Vertex and Edge Sets

In classic (Syntax v1) GSQL, the FROM clause described one step or hop pattern. In link:./#pattern-matching-syntax-v-2[Pattern Matching] (Syntax v2), the pattern can be multiple hops long. Path patterns also have many other options for finer control and greater flexibility.

{% code title="FROM clause" %}

[source,sql]
----
fromClause := FROM (step | stepV2 | pathPattern ["," pathPattern]*)
----

{% endcode %}

A hop or step consists of going from a starting set of vertices, crossing over a set of their edges, to an ending set of vertices. We typically use the names Source and Target for the starting and ending vertex sets: `+Source -(Edges)-> Target+`

The step pattern defines constraints for the Source set, the Edge set, and the Target set. The result of the FROM clause can be interpreted as a 3-column virtual table called the match table. Each row is a 3-element tuple: (source vertex, connected edge, target vertex).

=== Source Vertex Set (SYNTAX v1)

Notice that the edge set and target set are optional: a step can be just source vertices (stepSourceSet).

{% code title="EBNF for source-only pattern (SYNTAX v1)" %}

[source,erlang]
----
step   :=  stepSourceSet ["-" "(" stepEdgeSet ")" ("-"|"->") stepVertexSet]
----

{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Rules for Source Vertex Set in Syntax V1:

. The source set may only be a vertexSetName. If this the first SELECT statement in the query, then the vertexSetName is generally created as a seedsSet:
. The vertexSetName is optionally followed by an alias, which used in subsequent clauses to refer to the source set:
+
[source,sql]
----
stepSourceSet := vertexSetName [":" vertexAlias]
vertexAlias := name
----
+
{% endhint %}

For example:

[source,sql]
----
resultSet = SELECT s FROM Source:s;
----

This statement can be interpreted as "_Select all vertices s, from the vertex set Source_ ." The result is a vertex set. Below is a simple example of a vertex selection.

=== 1-Hop Step (SYNTAX v1)

Usually, a FROM clause has a full 1-hop step.

[source,erlang]
----
step   :=  stepSourceSet ["-" "(" stepEdgeSet ")" ("-"|"->") stepVertexSet]
----

The symbols `-(` and `)-` enclose the stepEdgeSet and separate the three parts. Each of the three parts may also define an alias, which makes a convenient way to refer to each of the three sets of entities.

[source,erlang]
----
stepSourceSet := vertexSetName [":" vertexAlias]
stepEdgeSet := [setEdgeTypes] [":" edgeAlias]
stepVertexSet := [setVertexTypes] [":" vertexAlias]
----

Below is a simple example:

[source,sql]
----
Person:s -( (Bought|Rented):e )- (Product|Service):t
----

The Source set is all Persons, but the pattern will not include all Persons. It will only include those Persons who Bought or Rented a Product or Service. Moreover, the result will be a set of matched triples: (s, e, t). For example, if Sam bought a TV and Andy rented a car, the results will include (Sam, Bought, TV) and (Andy, Rented, Car). However, these two facts do not imply (Sam, Rented, Car) or (Andy, Rented, TV).

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: The GSQL grammar allows the righthand enclosure to be either `)-` or +
`+)->+`. Previously, we recommended the arrowhead `+)->+` . However, for better compatibility with the new V2 pattern matching syntax, we now recommend the headless version: `)-` Syntax v2 has a specific semantic meaning for the arrowheads.
{% endhint %}

=== Edge Set and Target Vertex Set Options

{% hint style="info" %}
*Rules for Edge Set and Target Set in Syntax V1:*

. The edge set (*`stepEdgeSet`*) and target vertex set (*`stepVertexSet`*) obey very similar rules. Each may be a set specifier (*`stepEdgeTypes`* or *`stepVertexTypes`*) followed optionally by an alias.
. The set specifier can be any of the following:
 ** *`"_"`* or *`"ANY"`* or <blank>, which means any edge/vertex.
 ** a named type (*`edgeType`* or *`vertexType`*)
 ** a global SetAcum accumulator containing a set of edges or vertices (*`"@@"accumName`*)
 ** a string or string set parameter which names one or more edge or vertex types  (*`paramName`*) This parameterized type is one aspect of link:../query-operations.md#dynamic-querying[*Dynamic Querying*].
 ** A list of types, string parameters, or global accumulators, e.g., *`"(" edgeSetType ["|" edgeSetType]* ")"`*
 ** The list of types must contain the same type of specifiers.

|===

{% hint style="info" %}
Parentheses are always needed around the edge type in a FROM clause: +
FROM Source:s -(eType:e)- Target:t

Parentheses are also needed if a vertexEdgeType is the union of more than one or more individual edge types or vertex types: +
FROM Source:s -((eType1 | eType2):e) - Target:t

Note the double set of parentheses for the edge specifier. If these is an edge alias, these parentheses are needed. If however there is no edge alias, it is legal to have just a single set of parentheses: +
FROM Source:s -(eType1 | eType2) - Target:t
{% endhint %}

Either the source vertex set ( s ) or target vertex set ( t ) can be used as the SELECT argument, which determines the result of the SELECT statement. Note the small difference in the two SELECT statements below.

{% code title="Selecting source or target vertices from edge-induced selection" %}

[source,sql]
----
resultSet1 = SELECT s FROM source:s-(eType:e)-tType:t;   //select from the source set
resultSet2 = SELECT t FROM source:s-(eType:e)-tType:t;   //select from the target set
----

{% endcode %}

resultSet1 is based on the source end of the edges. resultSet2 is based on the target end of the selected edges. However, resultSet1 is NOT identical to the Source vertex set. It is only those members of Source which connect to an eType edge and then to a tType vertex. Other clauses (presented later in this "SELECT Statement" section, can do additional filtering of the Source set.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 We strongly suggest that an alias should be declared with every vertex and edge in the FROM clause, as there are several functions and features which are only available to vertex and edge aliases.
{% endhint %}

If is legal to declare an alias without explicitly stating an edge/target type. See the examples below.

{% code title="Target vertex type inference" %}

[source,sql]
----
resultSet3 = SELECT v FROM Source:v-(eType:e)->(V1|V2):t;
resultSet4 = SELECT v FROM Source:v-(eType:e)->:t;

=== Vertex and Edge Aliases

Vertex and edge _aliases_ are declared within the FROM clause of a SELECT block, by using the character ":", followed by the alias name. Aliases can be accessed anywhere within the same SELECT block. They are used to reference a single selected vertex or edge of a set. It is through the vertex or edge aliases that attributes of these vertices or edges can be accessed.

For example, the following code snippets show two different SELECT statements. The first SELECT statement starts from a vertex set called allVertices, and the vertex alias name *v* can access each individual vertex from allVertices. The second SELECT statement selects a set of edges. It can use the vertex alias *s* to reference the source vertices, or the alias *t* to reference the target vertices.

{% code title="Vertex variables" %}

[source,erlang]
----
results = SELECT v FROM allVertices:v;
results = SELECT t FROM allVertices:s -()-> :t;
----

{% endcode %}

The following example shows an edge-based SELECT statement, declaring aliases for all three parts of the edge. In the ACCUM clause, the `e` and `t` aliases are assigned to local vertex and edge variables.

{% code title="Edge variables" %}

[source,erlang]
----
results = SELECT v
          FROM allVertices:s -(:e)-> :t
          ACCUM VERTEX v = t, EDGE eg = e;
----

{% endcode %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
We strongly suggest that an alias should be declared with every vertex and edge in the FROM clause, as there are several functions and features only available to vertex and edge aliases.
{% endhint %}

=== Pattern Matching (SYNTAX v2)

We give a brief overview of Pattern Matching syntax and semantics in the FROM clause, from the perspective of the formal notation and how the rules can be inferred from that. For a more practical explanation of Pattern Matching, we recommend the link:../../../../start/gsql-102/[GSQL102 Pattern Matching] tutorial.

There are three options for the syntax of the pattern in a FROM clause:

[source,erlang]
----
fromClause := FROM (step | stepV2 | pathPattern ["," pathPattern]*)
----

. `step` pattern, SYNTAX v1. This is the default syntax from classic GSQL.
. `stepV2` pattern, SYNTAX v2. The query or the GSQL session must link:../../../../start/gsql-102/[specify that SYNTAX v2 is to be used]. This is still a 1-Hop query, but there are two differences:
 ** The source vertex set now has the same flexibility as the target vertex. It is not necessary to create a seedSet. Instead, the source can be one or more vertex types, given either statically or dynamically as string parameters, or the special symbol `ANY` or `_`.
 ** The arrowhead `+-( )->+` should not be used between the edge set and the target set. Simple use a dash `-( )-`.
. One or more `pathPattern` s.

A pathPattern begins with a `stepVertexSet` and then has one or more hops across and edge set to a target set: `-(pathEdgePattern)-setVertexSet.`

[source,sql]
----
pathPattern := stepVertexSet ["-" "(" pathEdgePattern ")" "-" stepVertexSet]*
----

We have already studied stepVertexSet. Now we will look at the options for `pathEdgePattern` and their meanings.

[source,erlang]
----
pathEdgePattern := atomicEdgePattern
                 | "(" pathEdgePattern ")"
                 | pathEdgePattern "." pathEdgePattern
                 | disjPattern
                 | starPattern

atomicEdgePattern  := atomicEdgeType		
        	        | atomicEdgeType ">"	
        	        | "<" atomicEdgeType	

atomicEdgeType := "_" | ANY | edgeSetType
edgeSetType := edgeType | paramName | globalAccumName
----

The most basic form for a `pathEdgePattern` is an `atomicEdgePattern`. This in turn can be, similar to `stepVertexSet`, one of the following:

* "_" or "ANY"
* an edgeType, a string parameter, or a global SetAccum accumulator.

==== Edge Direction

Moreover, an `atomicEdgePattern` can have either a left pointer "<" on the left or a right pointer ">" on the right. These indicate edge direction, of course. If no pointer is used, then the edge is undirected. Suppose we have 3 edge types or parameters called A, B, C.

* A> is a rightward facing A edge
* <B is a leftward facing B edge
* C is an undirected C edge. If C is actually a directed edge type, then there is no match.

==== Disjunction, Repeats, and Dot Concatenation

Looking at the remaining options for pathEdgePattern, we see that we can have parentheses around it, we can use a dot "." between two pathEdgePatterns, or we can have a disjPattern or starPattern.

*disjPattern* is how we write "either this edge pattern or that edge pattern""

[source,erlang]
----
disjPattern := atomicEdgePattern ("|" atomicEdgePattern)*
----

For example, we can combine the three direction-specfic examples from above: `(A> | <B | C)`

**starPatter**n explains how the Kleene star and min..max range specifiers can be used to say "repeat this edge pattern from min to max times."

[source,erlang]
----
starPattern := ([atomicEdgePattern] | "(" disjPattern ")") "*" [starBounds]

starBounds := CONST_INT ".." CONST_INT
            | CONST_INT ".."
            | ".." CONST_INT
            | CONST_INT
----

For example,`(A> | <B | C)*2..4` means "a series of 2 to 4 adjacent edges, where each edge has type A>, <B, or C. Note that we do not have to use the same edge type for all the repeats. Either iteration can select an option from `disjPattern`.

*The dot operator* means concatenate the two edge patterns into one. Naturally, there must be a vertex joining the two edges, but it is omitted from the syntax. The dot operator is a shorthand, when you don't care about the type of that intermediate vertex. +
`(A>.<B.C)` means a series of 3 edges, having the specifying types and directions.

=== Conjunctive Pattern Matching

The optional repeating phrase `["," pathPattern]*` allows you to have multiple pathPatterns. They form a conjunction, meaning all of them must be satisfied in order to have a valid match result.

[source,erlang]
----
fromClause := FROM (step | stepV2 | pathPattern ["," pathPattern]*)
----

Recall that each step pattern or path pattern forms a match table, one row per matching path in the graph. Each vertex alias or edge alias is one column in the table.  When we have a conjunctive path, each path must share at least one vertex alias with another path. This enables the two path sets (and match tables) to be joined. Formally, we make the natural join of the two tables.

This explains all of the syntax for the FROM clause with SYNTAX v2 (Pattern Matching). The other significant area to consider for SYNTAX v2 is the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses.

== SAMPLE Clause

The SAMPLE clause is an optional clause that selects a uniform random sample from the population of edges or target vertices specified in the FROM argument.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to sample from a set of vertices directly, not from edges or from neighboring (target) vertices, then the following technique is simpler and faster:
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Select k random vertices from a vertex set S" %}

[source,erlang]
----
random = SELECT s
         FROM S:s
         LIMIT k;
----

{% endcode %}

The SAMPLE clause draws from the edge population consisting of those edges which satisfy all three parts -- source set, edge type, and target type -- of the FROM clause. The SAMPLE clause is intended to provide a representative sample of the distribution of edges (or vertices) connected to _hub_ vertices, instead of dealing with all edges. A _hub_ vertex is a vertex with a relatively high degree. (The _degree_ of a vertex is the number of edges which connect to it. If edges are directional, one can distinguish between indegree and outdegree.)

{% code title="EBNF for Sample Clause" %}

[source,erlang]
----
sampleClause := SAMPLE ( expr | expr "%" ) EDGE WHEN condition # sample an absolute number (or a percentage) of edges for each source vertex.
              | SAMPLE expr TARGET WHEN condition              # sample an absolute number of edges incident to each target vertex.
              | SAMPLE expr "%" TARGET PINNED WHEN condition   # sample a percentage of edges incident to each target vertex.
----

{% endcode %}

The expression following SAMPLE specifies the sample size, either an absolute number or a percentage of the population. The expression in sampleClause must evaluate to a positive integer. There are two sampling methods. One is sampling based on edge id. The other is based on target vertex id: if a target vertex id is sampled, all edges from this source vertex to the sampled target vertex are sampled.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: Currently, the WHEN condition that can be used with a SAMPLE clause is limited strictly to checking if the result of a function call on a vertex is greater than or greater than/equal to some number.
{% endhint %}

Given that the sampling is random, some of the details of each of the example queries may change each time they are run.

The following query displays two modes of sampling: an absolute number of edges from a source vertex and a percentage of edges fro a source vertex. We use the computerNet graph (see Appendix D).  In computerNet, there are 31 vertices and 43 edges, but only 7 vertices are source vertices. Moreover, c1, c12, and c23 are hub nodes, with at least 10 outgoing edges each.  For the absolute count case, we set the size to 1 edge per source vertex, which is equivalent to a random walk. We expect exactly 7 edges to be selected.  For the percentage sampling case, we sample 33% of the edges for vertices which have 3 or more outgoing edges. We expect about 15 edges, but the number may vary.

{% endcode %}

Below is an example of using SELECT to only traverse one edge for each source vertex. The vertex-attached accumulators @timesTraversedNoSample and @timesTraversedWithSample are used to keep track of the number of times an edge is traversed to reach the target vertex. Without using sampling, this occurs once for each edge; thus @timesTraversedNoSample has the same number as the in-degree of the vertex. With sampling edges, the number of edges is restricted. This is reflected in the @timesTraversedWithSample accumulator. Notice the difference in the result set. Because only one edge per source vertex is traversed when the SAMPLE clause is used, not all target vertices are reached. The vertex *company3* has 3 incident edges, but in one instance of the query execution, it is never reached. Additionally, *company2* has 6 incident edges, but only 4 source vertices sampled an edge incident to *company2* .

== WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause is an optional clause that constrains edges and vertices specified in the FROM and SAMPLE clauses.

{% code title="EBNF for Where Clause" %}

[source,erlang]
----
whereClause := WHERE condition
----

{% endcode %}

The WHERE clause uses a boolean condition to test each vertex or edge in the FROM set (or the sampled vertex and edge sets, if the SAMPLE clause was used).

If the expression evaluates to false for vertex/edge X, then X excluded from further consideration in the result set. The expression may use constants or any variables or parameters within the scope of the SELECT, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /,%), comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >,>=), boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), set operators (IN, NOT IN) and parentheses to enforce precedence. The WHERE conditional expression may use any of the variables within its scope (global accumulators, vertex set variables, query input parameters, the FROM clause's vertex and edge sets (or their vertex and edge aliases), or any of the attributes or accumulators of the vertex/edge sets.) For a more formal explanation of condition, see the EBNF definitions of *condition* and *expr.*

Using built-in vertex and edge attributes and functions, such as .type and .neighbors(), the WHERE clause can be used to implement sophisticated selection rules for the edge traversal.  In the following example, the selection conditions are completely specified in the WHERE clause, with no edge types or vertex types mentioned in the FROM clause.

{% code title="WHERE used as a filter" %}

[source,sql]
----
resultSet1 = SELECT v FROM S:v-((E1|E2|E3):e)->(V1|V2):t;
resultSet2 = SELECT v FROM S:v-(:e)->:t
					 WHERE t.type IN ("V1", "V2") AND
						   t IN v.neighbors("E1|E2|E3")

If multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, the WHERE clause should use OR to separate each edge type or each target vertex type. For example,

{% code title="Multiple Edge Type WHERE clause" %}

[source,erlang]

CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeWhereEx(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet {
  allUser = {m1};
  FilteredUser = SELECT s
      FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) -> (post|person):t
      # WHERE e.actionTime > epoch_to_datetime(1) AND t.gender == "Male";
      WHERE ( e.type == "liked" AND e.actionTime > epoch_to_datetime(1) ) OR
            ( e.type == "friend" AND t.gender == "Male" )
            ;
  PRINT FilteredUser;
}
----

{% endcode %}

The above query is compilable. However, if we use line 5 as the WHERE clause instead, the query is not compilable. The edge-type conflict checking detects an error, because i t uses attributes from both "liked" edges and "friend" edges without separating them out by OR.
{% endhint %}

== ACCUM and POST-ACCUM Clauses

The optional ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses enable sophisticated aggregation and other computations across the set of vertices or edges selected by the preceding FROM, SAMPLE, and WHERE clauses. A query can contain one or both of these clauses. The statements in an ACCUM clause are applied for every edge in an edge-induced selection or every vertex in a vertex-induced selection.

If there is more than one statement in the ACCUM clause, the statements are separated by commas and executed sequentially for each selected element. However, the TigerGraph system uses parallelism to improve performance. Within an ACCUM clause, each edge is handled by a separate process. As such, there is no fixed order in which the edges are processed within the ACCUM clause and the edges should not be treated as executing sequentially. The accumulators are mutex variables shared among each of these processes. The results of any accumulation within the ACCUM clause is not complete until all edges are traversed. Any inspection of an intermediate result within the ACCUM is incomplete and may not be that meaningful.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 The statements within the ACCUM clause are executed sequentially for a given vertex or edge.  However, there is no fixed order in which a vertex set or edge set is processed.
{% endhint %}

The optional POST-ACCUM clause enables aggregation and other computations across the set of vertices (but not edges) selected by the preceding clauses. POST-ACCUM can be used without ACCUM. If it is preceded by an ACCUM clause, then it can be used for 2-stage accumulative computation: a first stage in ACCUM followed by a second stage in POST-ACCUM.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 Each statement within the POST-ACCUM clause can refer to either source vertices or target vertices but not both.
{% endhint %}

Since the ACCUM clause iterates over edges, and often two edges will connect to the same source vertex or to the same target vertex, the ACCUM clause can be repeated multiple times for one vertex.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 Operations that are to be performed exactly once per vertex should be performed in the POST-ACCUM clause.
{% endhint %}

The primary purpose of the ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause is to collect information about the graph by updating accumulators (via += or =). See the "Accumulator" section for details on the += operation. However, other kinds of statements (e.g., branching, iteration, local assignments) are permitted to support more complex computations or to log activity. The EBNF syntax below defines the allowable kinds of statements that can occur within an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM.  The *dmlSubStmt* list is similar to the *queryBodyStmt* list which applies to statements outside of a SELECT block; it is important to note the differences.  Each of these statement types is discussed in one of the main sections of this reference document.

 Note that dml-sub-statements do not include global accumulator assignment statement (gAccumAssignStmt) but global accumulator accumulation statement (gAccumAccumStmt). Global accumulators may perform accumulation += but not assignment "=" within these clauses.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There are additional restrictions on dml-sub level statements:

* Global variable assignment is permitted in ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clauses, but the change in value will not take place until the query completes. Therefore, if there are multiple assignment statements for the same variable, only the final one will take effect.
* Vertex attribute assignment "=" is not permitted in an ACCUM clause. However, edge attribute assignment is permitted. This is because the ACCUM clause iterates over an edge set. Vertex attribute attribute assignment is permitted in the POST-ACCUM clause. Like all updates, the change in value does not take place until the query completes.
{% endhint %}

=== Aliases and ACCUM/POST-ACCUM Iteration Model

To reference each element of the selected set, use the aliases defined in the FROM clause.  For example, assume that we have the following aliases:

{% code title="Example of vertex and edge aliases" %}

[source,erlang]
----
FROM source:s -(edgeTypes:e)-> targetTypes:t # edge-induced selection
FROM source:v                                # vertex-induced selection
----

{% endcode %}

Let  (V1, V2,... Vn) be the vertices in the vertex-induced selection . The following pseudocode emulates ACCUM clause behavior.

{% code title="Model for ACCUM behavior in vertex-induced selection" %}

[source,erlang]
----
FOREACH v in (V1,V2,...Vn) DO # iterations may occur in parallel, in unknown order
  dmlSubStmts referencing v
DONE
----

{% endcode %}

Let E = (E1, E2,... En) be the edges in the edge-induced selected set. Further, let S = (S1,S1,...Sn) and T= (T1,T2,...Tn) be the multisets (bags) of source vertices and target vertices which correspond to the edge set.  S and T are bags, because they can contain repeated elements.

{% code title="Model for ACCUM behavior in edge-induced selection" %}

[source,erlang]
----
FOREACH i in (1..n) DO # iterations may occur in parallel, in unknown order
  dmlSubStmts referencing e, s, t, which really means e_i, s_i, t_i
DONE
----

{% endcode %}

Note that any reference to the source alias s or target alias t is for the endpoint vertices of the current edge.

Similarly, the POST-ACCUM clause acts like a FOREACH loop on the vertex result set specified in the SELECT clause (e.g., either S or T).

=== Pattern Matching ACCUM and POST-ACCUM

In Pattern Matching (SYNTAX v2), we may have a multi-step pattern, with several vertex and edge aliases. Each statement (dml-sub-statement) can refer to one or more aliases. There are no restrictions, though complex expressions and accessing multiple aliases may degrade performance.

*The PER clause* is available only in SYNTAX v2. It is an optional prefix to the ACCUM clause, affecting only that clause. The PER clause allows the user to specify that they wish to aggregate the match table, so that there is one row PER <alias>. For more information see the xref:../../../../start/gsql-102/adv/per-clause.adoc[PER Clause section in the Pattern Matching tutorial].

*Multiple POST-ACCUM clauses* are supported in TG 3.0+. In SYNTAX v2, Each POST-ACCUM may refer to only one vertex alias. See the link:../../../../start/gsql-102/multiple-hop-and-accumulation.md#post-accum-clause[POST-ACCUM section in the Pattern Matching]tutorial.

=== Edge/Vertex Type Inference and Conflict

If multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, each ACCUM statement in ACCUM clause checks whether edge types are conflicted. If only a subset of edge types are effective in an ACCUM statement , this statement is not executed on other edge types. For example:

{% code title="Multiple Edge Type ACCUM statement check" %}

[source,erlang]
----
CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeCheckEx(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet {
  ListAccum<STRING> @@testList1, @@testList2, @@testList3;
  allUser = {m1};
  allUser = SELECT s
         FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) -> (post|person):t
         ACCUM @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime))
              ,@@testList2 += t.gender
             #,@@testList3 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime)) + t.gender # illegal
               ;
  PRINT @@testList1, @@testList2, @@testList3;
}
----

{% endcode %}

In the above example, line 6 is only executed on "liked" edges, because "actionTime" is the attribute of "liked" edge only. Similarly, line 7 is only executed on "friend" edges, because "gender" is the attribute of "person" only, and only "friend" edge uses "person" as target vertex. However, line 8 causes a compilation error, because it uses multiple edges where some edges cannot be supported in a part of the statement, i.e., "liked" edges doesn't have t.gender, "friend" edges doesn't have e.actionTime.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We strongly suggest that if multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, ACCUM clauses should uses CASE statement (see Section "Control Flow Statements" for more details) to separate the operation on each edge type or each target vertex type (or combination of target vertex type and edge type). The edge-type conflict checking then checks the ACCUM statement inside each THEN/ELSE blocks based on the condition. For example,

{% code title="Multiple Edge Type ACCUM statement check 2" %}

[source,erlang]
----
CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeCheckEx2(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet {
  ListAccum<STRING> @@testList1;
  allUser = {m1};
  allUser = SELECT s
            FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) -> (post|person):t
            ACCUM CASE
                    WHEN e.type == "liked" THEN    # for liked edges
                      @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime))
                    WHEN e.type == "friend" THEN   # for friend edges
                      @@testList1 += t.gender
                    ELSE      # For the remained edge type, which is posted edges
                      @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(t.postTime))
                  END
            ;
  PRINT @@testList1;
}
----

{% endcode %}

The above query is compilable. However, if we switch line 8 and line 10, the edge-type conflict checking generates errors because "liked" edges doesn't support t.gender and "friend" edges doesn't support e.actionTime.
{% endhint %}

Similar to the ACCUM clause, if multiple source/target vertex types are specified in edge-induced selection and the POST-ACCUM clauses accesses source/target vertex, each ACCUM statement in POST-ACCUM clause checks whether source/target vertex types are conflicted. If only a subset of source/target vertex types are effective in a POST-ACCUM statement, this statement is not executed on other source/target vertex types.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 Similar to ACCUM clause, we strongly suggest that if multiple source/target vertex types are specified in edge-induced selection and the POST-ACCUM clauses accesses source/target vertex, POST-ACCUM clauses should uses CASE statement (see Section "Control Flow Statements" for more details) to separate the operation on each source/target vertex type. The vertex type conflict checking then checks the ACCUM statement inside each THEN/ELSE blocks based on the condition.
{% endhint %}

=== Rules for Updating Vertex-Attached Accumulators

Prior to v1.0, a vertex-attached accumulator could only be updated in an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause and only if its vertex was selected for by the preceding FROM-SAMPLE-WHERE clauses.

Beginning in v1.0, there are additional circumstances where a vertex-attached accumulator may be updated. Vertices which are _referenced via a vertex-attached accumulator of a selected vertex_ may have their vertex-attached accumulators updated in the ACCUM clause (but not in the POST-ACCUM clause).  That is, a vertex referenced by an selected vertex can be updated, with some limitations explained below. Some examples will help to illustrate this more complex condition.

* Suppose a query declares a vertex-attached _accumulator which holds vertex information_ . We call this a *vertex-holding accumulator* . This could take several forms:
 ** A scalar accumulator, e.g., MaxAccum< *VERTEX* > @maxV;
 ** A collection accumulator: e.g., ListAccum< *VERTEX* > @listV;
 ** An accumulator containing tuple(s), where the tuple type contains a *VERTEX* field.
* If a vertex V is selected, then not only can V's accumulators be updated, but the vertices stored in its vertex-holding accumulators can also be updated, in the ACCUM clause.
* Before these indirectly referenced vertices can be used, they need to be *activated* . There are two ways to activate an indirect vertex:
 ** A vertex from a vertex-holding accumulator is first assigned to a local vertex variable.  The vertex can now be updated through the local vertex variable.

[source,erlang]
----
ACCUM
  VERTEX<person> mx = tgt.@maxV,   # assign to local variable
          mx.@curId += src.id      # access via local variable
----

* A FOREACH loop can iterate on a vertex-holding collection accumulator. The vertices can now be updated through the loop variable.

[source,erlang]
----
ACCUM
  FOREACH vtx IN src.@setIds DO   # iterate on collection accumulator
      vtx.@curId += tgt.id        # access via loop variable
  END
----

{% hint style="danger" %}
 The following uses are NOT supported by the new rules:

* Indirectly activated vertices may not be updated in the POST-ACCUM clause or outside of a SELECT statement.
* Passing a vertex into the query as an input parameter is not a route to activation.
* Using a global vertex-holding accumulator is not a route to activation.
* If a vertex is being indirectly activated by assigning it to a local variable (e.g., a variable declaring in ACCUM or POST-ACCUM), note the following rule, which always applies to all local variables:
 ** A local variable can be declared and initialized in an ACCUM block once.  It cannot be redeclared or reassigned later in the ACCUM block.
{% endhint %}

The following query demonstrates updates to indirectly activated vertices.

== HAVING Clause

The optional HAVING clause provides constraints on the result set of the SELECT. The constraints are applied *after* ACCUM and POST-ACCUM actions. This differs from the WHERE clause, which is applied *before* the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM actions.

{% code title="EBNF for HAVING Clause" %}

[source,erlang]
----
havingClause := HAVING condition
----

{% endcode %}

A HAVING clause can only be used if there is an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause . The condition is applied to each vertex in the SELECT set (either source or target vertices) which also fulfilled the FROM and WHERE conditions. The HAVING clause is intended to test one or more of the accumulator variables that were updated in the ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause, though the condition may be anything that equates to a boolean value. If the condition is false for a particular vertex, then that vertex is excluded from the result set.

The following example demonstrates using the HAVING clause to constrain a result set based on the vertex accumulator variable which was updated during the ACCUM clause.

{% code title="Example 1. HAVING" %}

[source,erlang]
----
# find all persons meeting a given activityThreshold, based on how many posts or likes a person has made
CREATE QUERY activeMembers(int activityThreshold) FOR GRAPH socialNet
{
        SumAccum<int> @activityAmount;

        result = SELECT v FROM start:v -(:e)-> post:tgt
                          ACCUM v.@activityAmount +=1
	                      HAVING v.@activityAmount >= activityThreshold;
        PRINT result;
}
----

If the activityThreshold parameter is set to 3, the query returns 5 vertices:

The following shows an example of equivalent result sets from using WHERE vs. HAVING. Recall that the WHERE clause is evaluated before the ACCUM and that the HAVING clause is evaluated after the ACCUM. Both constrain the result set based on a condition that vertices must meet.

== ORDER BY Clause

The optional ORDER BY clause sorts the result set.

{% code title="EBNF for ORDER BY Clause" %}

[source,sql]
----
orderClause := ORDER BY expr [ASC | DESC] ["," expr [ASC | DESC]]*
----

{% endcode %}

ASC specifies ascending order (least value first), and DESC specifies descending order (greatest value first). If neither is specified, then ascending order is used. Each expr must refer to the attributes or accumulators of a member of the result set, and the expr must evaluate to a sortable value (e.g., a number or a string). ORDER BY offers hierarchical sorting by allowing a comma-separated list of expressions, sorting first by the leftmost expr.  It uses the next expression only to sort items where the current sort expr results in identical values. Any items in the result set which cannot be sorted (because the sort expressions do not pertain to them) will appear at the end of the set, after the sorted items.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In tabular SELECT queries, the ORDER BY expressions may only be SELECT column aliases.
{% endhint %}

The following example demonstrates the use of ORDER BY with multiple expressions. The returned vertex set is first ordered by the number of friends of the vertex, and then ordered by the number of coworkers of that vertex.

{% code title="topPopular.gsql: ORDER BY Descending" %}

== LIMIT Clause

The optional LIMIT clause sets constraints on the number and ranking of items included in the final result set.

{% code title="EBNF for LIMIT Clause" %}

[source,sql]
----
limitClause := LIMIT ( expr | expr "," expr | expr OFFSET expr )
----

{% endcode %}

Each of the expr must evaluate to a nonnegative integer. To understand LIMIT, note that the tentative result set is held in the computer as a list of vertices. If the query has an ORDER BY clause, the order is specified; otherwise the list order is unknown.  Assume we number the vertices as v_1 , v_2 , ..., v_n . The LIMIT clause specifies a range of vertices, starting from a lower position in the list to an upper position.

There are three forms:

{% code title="LIMIT scenarios" %}

[source,erlang]
----
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)-> :v LIMIT k;		  # case 1: k = Count
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)-> :v LIMIT j, k; 	  # case 2: j = Offset from the start of the list, k = Count
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)-> :v LIMIT k OFFSET j; # case 3: k = Count, j = Offset from the start of the list
----

{% endcode %}

Case 1: LIMIT k

* When a single expr is provided, LIMIT returns the first *k* elements from the tentative result set. If there are fewer than *k* elements available, then all elements will be returned in the result set.  If k=5 and the tentative result set has at least 5 items, then the final result list will be [ v_1 , v_2 , v_3 , v_4 , v_5 ].

Case 2: LIMIT j, k

* When a comma separates two expressions, LIMIT treats the first expression *j* as an offset.  That is, it skips the first *j* items in the list.  The second expr *k* tells the maximum number of items items to include. If the list has at least 7 items, then LIMIT 2, 5 would return [ v_3 , v_4 , v_5, v_6  _,_ v_7 ].

Case 3: LIMIT k OFFSET j

* The behavior of Case 3 is the same as that of Case 2, except that the syntax is different.  The keyword OFFSET separates the two expressions, and the count comes before the offset, rather than vice versa. If the list has at least 7 items, then LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2 would return [ v_3 , v_4 , v_5, v_6 , v_7 ].

If any of the expressions evaluate to a negative integer, the results are undefined.

{% hint style="info" %}
 OFFSET is intended for result sets which are in a known order. It is a compile time error to use OFFSET without the ORDER BY clause.
{% endhint %}

The following examples demonstrate the various forms of the LIMIT clause.

The first example shows the LIMIT clause when used as an upper limit. It returns a result set with a maximum size of 4 elements in the set.

In a large data set, limitTest(5,20) might return 20 vertices, but since we don't have 25 vertices in the original data, the output was fewer than 20 vertices.
