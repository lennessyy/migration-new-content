= Database Definition
:sectnums:

Before you can load data into a graph and write queries on TigerGraph, you must first define a graph schema.
A graph schema in TigerGraph is made up of different vertex types and edge types.
Each vertex and edge type have their own attributes.

Database definition operations happen in two stages:

==  Define a schema
A graph schema is a "dictionary" that defines the types of entities, vertices and edges, in the graph and how those types of entities are related to one another.
Each vertex or edge type has a name and a set of attributes (properties) associated with it.
For example, a `Book` vertex could have title, author, publication year, genre, and language attributes.

==  Modify a schema
