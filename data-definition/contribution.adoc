= Documentation process

== Everyone
Every user of the TigerGraph documentation can make PRs when they see a typo, grammar mistake, or technical inaccuracy.
Click on "Edit this page" in the upper-right corner.

== Requesters
Anyone can request new features, changes, issue fixes to the documentation.
When making a request for documentation, in addition to providing information that can help writers produce the draft, name a person to be the reviewer for the draft.

If the requester does not name a reviewer, then the requester bears the responsibility of answering questions and reviewing the draft.

== Writers
=== Decide the location of the new documentation
Work in a clone of the source repository in a new branch, and identify there the feature should go.

== Reviewers
