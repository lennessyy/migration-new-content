= Cluster Shrinking

Shrinking a cluster can make sense for a few reasons:

* Your workload has changed and you can operate a cluster with fewer resources.
* Your data volume is lower than projected.

Shrinking a cluster removes nodes from the cluster. The data stored on those nodes will be redistributed to the remaining nodes.

== Before you begin

* No loading jobs, queries, or REST requests are running on the new node or the cluster.
* Obtain a few key measures for the state of your data before shrinking, such as vertex counts/edge counts or certain query results. This will be useful in verifying data integrity after shrinking completes.

== Procedure

=== Step 1: Identify new cluster replication and partition

Before running any commands to shrink a cluster, make sure you have a clear idea of how the new cluster should be distributed. You should have the following information:

* The new replication factor of the cluster
* The new partitioning factor of the cluster
* The names and IP addresses of the nodes to be removed from the cluster

=== Step 2: Shrink the cluster

To shrink the cluster, run the `gadmin cluster shrink` command like below. If the shrinking involves changing the replication factor, use the `--ha <replicattion_factor>` option to indicate the new replication factor:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin cluster shrink node_ip_list [--ha <replication_factor>]
----

`node_ip_list` is the list of nodes you are removing from the cluster mapped to their IP addresses with a colon(`:`), and separated by a comma. Below is an example:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin cluster shrink m3:10.128.0.81,m4:10.128.0.82 --ha 1
----

==== Supply a staging location

Extra disk space is required during cluster shrinking. If more space is not available on the same disk, you can supply a staging location on a different disk to hold temporary data:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin cluster shrink m3:192.168.1.3,m4:192.168.1.4 --stagingPath /tmp/
----

If you choose to supply a staging location, make sure that the TigerGraph Linux user has write permission to the path you provide. The overall amount of space required for cluster shrinking on each node is `(1 + Math.ceil(oldPartition/newPartition) ) * dataRootSize`. `oldPartion` and `newPartition` each stand for the partitioning factor of the cluster before and after shrinking; `dataRootSize` stands for the size of the data root folder on the node.

For example, if you are shrinking from a 10-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 5, to a 6-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 3, and the size of the data root folder on a node is 50GB. Then you would need more than `(1 + Math.ceil(5/3)) * 50) = 150 GB` of free space on the staging path.

=== Step 3: Verify success and delete temporary files

When shrinking completes, you should see a message confirming the completion of the cluster change. The message will also include the location of the temporary files created during the operation.

Verify data integrity by comparing vertex/edge counts or query results to what they were before the shrinking. After confirming a successful cluster contraction, delete the temporary files to free up disk space.

=== Step 4: Uninstall TigerGraph on the removed nodes

Uninstall TigerGraph from the removed nodes by removing all root directories (`app`, `data` and `tmp`) except the log directory of TigerGraph.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For security reasons, `guninstall` is disabled on the removed nodes. Therefore, you need to delete TigerGraph by manually deleting the root directories.
{% endhint %}
