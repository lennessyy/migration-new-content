= Stop, Restart, and Terminate a Solution

== Stop a solution

When you stop a solution, you shut down the virtual machine instance. The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state. Billing for that machine instance also stops. Scheduled backups also stop, but the backup copies are kept in EFS on AWS, Azure Files on Azure, and GCP Filestore on GCP. You will still incur charges for disk storage and backups when a solution is stopped. You can start the solution again. After a warm-up period, the solution will return to its previous state.

Below are the steps to stop a solution

=== 1. Navigate to My Solutions.

== Terminate a solution

By terminating a solution, you deprovision the virtual machine and the attached disk storage. The solution is deleted according to the cloud platform's policies and cannot be recovered, so is everything in the attached disk storage.

Below are the steps to terminating a solution.

=== 1. Navigate to My Solutions.
