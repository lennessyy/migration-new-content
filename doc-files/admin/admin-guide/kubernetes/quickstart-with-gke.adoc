= Quickstart with GKE

This is a quick start guide for deploying TigerGraph on Kubernetes with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

* link:quickstart-with-gke.md#single-server-deployment[Single-server deployment]
* link:quickstart-with-gke.md#cluster-deployment[Cluster-deployment]

== Prerequisites

* The https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[`gcloud` command-line interface (CLI) is installed] on your machine.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[`kubectl` Kubernetes client command-line tool] is installed on your machine.
* A running GKE  cluster with nodes that meet the minimum xref:../hw-and-sw-requirements.adoc[hardware and software requirements]for running TigerGraph.
* You have https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl[configured cluster access for `kubectl`].

== Single-server deployment

This section describes the steps to deploy, verify, and remove a single-server deployment of TigerGraph on GKE.

=== Deploy single server

*Step 1: Generate deployment manifest*. Clone the https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys[TigerGraph ecosystems repository] and change into the `k8s` directory. You can edit the `kustimization.yaml` file in the `gke` folder to change the namespace and image name for your deployment. The default namespace is `default`. No need to edit the files if no changes are needed.

Next, run the `./tg` script in the `k8s` directory to generate the deployment manifest for a single-server deployment. A `deployment` directory will be created automatically and you should find the manifest named `tigergraph-gke.yaml` in the directory.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./tg gke kustomize -s 1
----

*Step 2: Deploy manifest*. Run `kubectl apply` to create the deployment using the manifest you generated in Step1.

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f deployment/tigergraph-gke.yaml
----

=== Verify single server

Run `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the pods were created successfully:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
installer-zsnb4   1/1     Running   0          4m11s
tigergraph-0      1/1     Running   0          4m10s
----

Run `kubectl describe service/tg-external-service` to find the IP address of the load balancer. You can then make curl calls to port 9000 to make sure that RESTPP is running:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl <load_balancer_ip>:9000/echo | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    39  100    39    0     0    120      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   120
{
  "error": false,
  "message": "Hello GSQL"
}
----

You can also copy the IP address into your browser and visit port 14240 to make sure that GraphStudio is working.

=== Connect to single server

You can use `kubectl` to get a shell to the container or log in via `ssh`

[source,text]
----
# Via kubectl
kubectl exec -it tigergraph-0 -- /bin/bash

# Via ssh
ip_m1=$(kubectl get pod -o wide |grep tigergraph-0| awk '{print $6}')
ssh tigergraph@ip_m1
----

=== Remove single server resources

Run the command below to delete all cluster resources:

[source,text]
----
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/tigergraph-gke.yaml && kubectl delete pvc -l app=tigergraph
----

== Cluster deployment

Once your GKE cluster is ready, you can start following the below steps to deploy a TigerGraph cluster on Kubernetes.

=== Deploy TigerGraph cluster

==== 1. Generate Kubernetes manifest

Clone the https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys.git[TigerGraph ecosystem repository] and change into the `k8s` directory:

[source,text]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys.git
$ cd ecosys/k8s
----

You can customize your deployment by editing the `kustomize.yaml` file in the `gke` directory. The `tg` script in the `k8s` folder offers a convenient way to make common customizations such as namespace, TigerGraph version, as well as cluster size. Run `./tg -h` to view the help text on how to use the script.

Use the `tg` script in the `k8s` directory of the repo to create a Kubernetes manifest.  Use `-s` or `--size` to indicate the number of nodes in the cluster. Use the `--ha` option to indicate the replication factor of the cluster, and the partitioning factor will be the number of nodes divided by the replication factor.

For example, the following command will create a manifest that will deploy a 3*2 cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 3.

[source,text]
----
$ ./tg gke kustomize -s 6 --ha 2
----

The command will create a directory named `deployment` with the manifest inside.

==== 2. Deploy the cluster

Run `kubectl apply` to create the deployment

[source,text]
----
$ kubectl apply -f ./deployment/tigergraph-gke.yaml
----

=== Verify cluster

Run `kubectl get pods` to verify the pods were created successfully:

[source,text]
----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
installer-zsnb4   1/1     Running   0          4m11s
tigergraph-0      1/1     Running   0          4m10s
tigergraph-1      1/1     Running   0          75s
----

Run `kubectl describe service/tg-external-service` to find the IP address of the load balancer for your GKE cluster. You can make a curl call to port 9000 to make sure that RESTPP is working:

[source,text]
----
$ curl <load_balancer_ip>:9000/echo | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    39  100    39    0     0    120      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   120
{
  "error": false,
  "message": "Hello GSQL"
}
----

You can also copy the IP address into your browser and visit port 14240 to make sure that GraphStudio is working.

=== Connect to instances

You can use `kubectl` to get a shell to the container or log in via `ssh`

[source,text]
----
# Via kubectl
kubectl exec -it tigergraph-0 -- /bin/bash

# Via ssh
ip_m1=$(kubectl get pod -o wide |grep tigergraph-0| awk '{print $6}')
ssh tigergraph@ip_m1
----

=== Delete cluster resources

Run the command below to delete all cluster resources:

[source,text]
----
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/tigergraph-gke.yaml && kubectl delete pvc -l app=tigergraph
----
